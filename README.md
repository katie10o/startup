# Silna 
### Your Health Your Way

_My Pitch:_
Silna makes monitoring your health more rewarding. Instead of focusing on the typical (and guilt induced) calorie-in calorie-out approach, it focuses on what you are getting out of the eating experience by keeping track of the minerals, vitamins, protiens, carbs, fats, and water in-take that come from our foods. It can suggest alternative options for your meals in order to recieve the fullest amount of nutrients that your body needs. This application is meant to make tracking your health fun and enlightening, instead of the often negative experience that happens with health talk.
